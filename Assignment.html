    <h1>Bandung</h1>
    <p><strong>Bandung</strong> is the 
        <i><a href="Capital_city.html"> capital city</a></i>
        of the 
        <i><a href="West_java.html">West Java</a></i> province of <i>Indonesia</i>.Located on the island of <i>Java</i>, the city is the <i>third largest city in Indonesia</i> and <i>Greater Bandung</i> (Bandung Basin Metropolitan Area / BBMA) is the country's second-largest and second most populous <i>metropolitan area</i>, with over 11 million inhabitants. Situated 768 meters (2,520 feet) <i>above sea level</i> (the highest point in the North area is at an altitude of 1,050 meters (3,445 feet), and the lowest in the South at 675 meters (2,215 feet) above sea level), approximately 135 kilometres (84 miles) southeast of Jakarta, Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other Indonesian cities. The city lies in a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains that provide a natural defense system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung.</p>
